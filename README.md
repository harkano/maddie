# Maddie Commands 

`!help` - Displays all commands

Syntax is as follows - <move>+/-<label>
`!engage+3`
`!support-2`
If you're using a playbook move not covered here you can use `!other+1`
The idea is to save you having the generic moves sheet open at any time.

I will be a bit less verbose if you prefix with !! (once you're comfortable with the detailed results) e.g. `!!unleash+2`

Type `!moves` to see the short version of help.
Type `!moves+` to get a more detailed explanation of all moves.
