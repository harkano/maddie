# Maddie Commands 

`!help` - Displays all commands

Syntax is as follows - <move>+/-<label>
`!engage+3`
`!support-2`
If you're using a playbook move not covered here you can use `!other+1`
The idea is to save you having the generic moves sheet open at any time.

I will be a bit less verbose if you prefix with !! (once you're comfortable with the detailed results) e.g. `!!unleash+2`

![Quiet Mode](https://i.imgur.com/5iVp7FK.png "Quiet Mode")

# Dataset

Note that the moveset is designed by a very open JSON format, so I'm potentially interested in adapting this for a variety of PBTA movesets.  I just wanted to run Masks first :)
